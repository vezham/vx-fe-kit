# Code Audits

Run `pnpm nx run @vx:@vx-ws/audit` to run the pinned Fallow and React Doctor versions.
Reports, logs, and a combined summary are written to `test-output/audit/`.
QA runs this in parallel with the other checks. Both tools must complete with
the configured `minimumScore`; lower or unavailable scores fail the audit job.
Both tools run even if one fails.

The Fallow gate uses `averageMaintainability`, recorded explicitly as
`scoreMetric` in `summary.json`. The separate overall `healthScore` is included
in reports and logs for information; it is not the gated score. Overall health
also penalizes long functions and Git-history hotspots.

The shared `summary-audit` action also publishes counts by category in the job
summary and separate Fallow and React Doctor commit comments on every QA run.
Existing tool comments are updated on reruns. Fallow includes its local average
maintainability score; React Doctor requests its score from its external scoring
API using diagnostic data. Unavailable scores are shown explicitly. These counts do not depend on the
artifact remaining available. Missing or failed audits are shown explicitly.
Commit comments require `contents: write`; commenting failures do not block QA.

`.fallowrc.jsonc` and `doctor.config.json` exclude generated output, caches,
vendored files, and declarations. Intentional app-template and mock duplication
is excluded only from duplication checks. Framework entry points and targeted
false positives are configured separately so authored code remains covered.
React Doctor supply-chain API calls remain disabled.

Review findings before adding suppressions. Do not add these audits to the
formatter; QA enforces the reviewed `minimumScore` baseline.

Preview Fallow's suggested cleanup with `pnpm exec fallow fix --dry-run` before
applying individual fixes. Confirm actual runtime, CSS, CLI, and optional peer
usage first: an unused-dependency suggestion alone is not proof a package can
be removed. Keep framework entry points and content collections registered in
`.fallowrc.jsonc` so their imports remain reachable during analysis.

The Fallow dependency exceptions cover these indirect uses:

- `@fontsource/inter` and `@fontsource/jura`: OG font files loaded with
  `require.resolve`; `@vezham/styles-v3`: imported from the shared CSS entry.
- The listed Pro optional peers: retained for the workspace's component demos
  and supported component features; review them when `@vezham/react-pro-v3`
  changes or those features are removed.
- `framework.toolingDependencies`: Nx-loaded ESLint configurations/plugins,
  the SWC loader and external helpers, TypeScript's `importHelpers`, config
  loading through Jiti, and the existing workspace CLI commands.
- Root-declared dependencies used by private workspace packages: this workspace
  installs them centrally instead of repeating declarations in each package.
  The exact names in `ignoreDependencies` were checked against the root manifest.
- `@vezham/react-v2`: intentionally retained as a build-time demo dependency.
  Revisit its placement if deployment starts installing production dependencies
  to execute code that imports it directly.

Use exact package names. `ignoreDependencies` suppresses both unused and
unlisted dependency findings, so keep these packages declared and review the
exceptions alongside dependency updates. Tool-only dependencies belong in
`framework.toolingDependencies` instead.

Fallow's average maintainability score also includes a penalty for each file's
number of imports. It is not a percentage of resolved findings; removing all
reported issues does not guarantee a score of 100.

Coverage enforcement is deferred while the workspace is a POC and CLI base.
Fallow sets `health.maxCrap` to `0` to disable coverage-based risk findings and
`rules.coverage-gaps` to `off`. Complexity and long-function findings remain
enabled. Fallow may still display estimated coverage and risk metrics; disabling
enforcement does not change the overall health score's fixed calibration.

The audit target depends on `test:eslint`, which runs the lint-rule tests and
generates a c8 coverage report before auditing. A test failure blocks the audit.
Run the tests separately with `pnpm nx run @vx:test:eslint`. Fallow does not
consume the coverage report while coverage enforcement is disabled. When
reintroducing enforcement, restore the report path and an appropriate risk
threshold.

The restoration TODO and previous coverage setting are kept beside `health` in
`.fallowrc.jsonc`. The separate `coverage-gaps` rule can remain off until its
findings are reviewed.

The small `dot-notation.mjs` rule remains together: its dependents include test
files, so the "split high-impact file" recommendation alone does not justify
splitting it. Keep this advisory visible rather than excluding the file from
health analysis. Boundary and policy checks require explicit configuration and
are not currently measured by this audit.
