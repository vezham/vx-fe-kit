# Release Versioning

This handbook documents how Vx app and package versions are managed.

## Version Shape

Use SemVer with a yearly major release line:

```text
27.0.0-alpha.1
27.0.0-beta.1
27.0.0
27.1.0
27.1.1
28.0.0-alpha.1
```

- Major: yearly/platform generation.
- Minor: feature release train inside that generation.
- Patch: fixes, chores, refactors, docs, tests, and maintenance releases.
- Prerelease: alpha, beta, or rc artifact trains.

## Runtime Flags

Keep artifact version and runtime behavior separate.

```env
V_APP_VER=27.0.0-alpha.1
V_IS_BETA=false
```

- `V_APP_VER` identifies the artifact.
- `V_IS_BETA` controls runtime/hosting behavior.

Do not infer `V_IS_BETA` from the version string. A beta host can run a stable
artifact, and a production host can temporarily run a prerelease artifact.

## App Version Sync

Main apps keep these files in sync:

```text
<apps-category>/<app>/package.json
<apps-category>/<app>/vx.config.json
<apps-category>/<app>/.env
```

`<apps-category>` can be any app category generated or managed by
`@vx-cli/react`, such as `apps_internals`, `apps_cdns`, `apps`, or another
workspace app grouping.

The source release step is `nx release`. The workspace config uses a custom
version action:

```json
"versionActions": "./vx/tools/release/version-actions.cjs"
```

That action extends Nx's JavaScript release behavior:

- Nx updates `package.json`.
- Vx additionally updates `vx.config.json` at `core.version` when the project
  has a Vx config file.
- `metadata:generate` then syncs `.env` keys such as `V_APP_VER` from
  `vx.config.json`.

## Release Commands

Use explicit major bumps for yearly generation changes:

```sh
pnpm nx release version major
```

Use conventional commits for normal minor/patch releases:

```sh
pnpm nx release version
```

Use prerelease commands for alpha or beta trains:

```sh
pnpm nx release version prerelease --preid alpha
pnpm nx release version prerelease --preid beta
```

Preview changes before writing files:

```sh
pnpm nx release version prerelease --preid alpha --dry-run
```

## Conventional Commits

The release config maps commit types like this:

- `feat`: minor
- `fix`: patch
- `build`: none
- `release`: none
- all other allowed commitlint types: patch

Current patch-default types:

- `chore`
- `ci`
- `deps`
- `docs`
- `i18n`
- `mocks`
- `perf`
- `refactor`
- `revert`
- `stories`
- `style`
- `test`

Yearly major bumps should be intentional release commands, not ordinary commit
types.

## Support Apps

Mock and e2e apps use stable workspace ids:

```env
V_APP_ID=play-start-mock
V_APP_ID=play-start-e2e
```

They do not need `V_APP_NAME`; the id is enough for logs, health responses, and
test tooling.
